    You may prefer using a folder outside of the usual preferences' location
    of sandboxed apps (in MacOS: ~/Library/Preferences) if your script is not
    a real application, especially in experimentation stages.
    You might not want to 'pollute' such an official
    directory and prefer this one instead, where you can simply create a
    subfolder for your app's settings and remove them whenever you want to
    reset the settings for instance.

        no reading + no writing) may
