# JMM lib



Library of helper functions, shortcuts and pieces of code that I reuse a lot.

Meant for my personal use and for reuse in my personal projects.



## Deploy



### On Github

See Git â€“ [Basics of tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) (Tags for versioning with Git & tags on Github)

Notes on "*(semantic) versioning*" : https://semver.org



#### Installing from Github

**Installing the latest version**

Stable releases are published in the `releases` branch. So to install the latest version, type:

```bash
# will install the latest version of branch `releases`
# (the -U option allows you to update the package)
pip install -U git+https://github.com/JeffMv/jmm-util-libs.git@releases
```



**Installing a specific version**

```bash
# To install a specific version, for instance version with tag v0.1.2.10.2 just type
# (add the -U option when you want to update, like "pip install -U ...")
pip install -U git+https://github.com/JeffMv/jmm-util-libs.git@v0.1.2.10.2
```



**Installing with extras**

```bash
# Add this in the requirements.txt file
# To install version v0.1.2.9.0 with the `parsing` extra
-e git+https://github.com/JeffMv/jmm-util-libs.git@v0.1.2.10.2 [parsing]
```



**General info**: In order to install a specific version from a git tag:

```bash
pip install -e "git://github.com/{ username }/{ reponame }.git@{ tag name }#egg={ desired egg name }"
